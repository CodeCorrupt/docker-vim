Vim {Docker}
==========

Docker image: [codecorrupt/vim](https://hub.docker.com/r/codecorrupt/vim/)

This is my Dockerfile with Vim 7.4 installed and my favorite suite of core plugins. These plugins are installed using vim-plug and you're welcome to take the docerfile and use your own prefered vimrc.

1. [Sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
2. [Vim airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
3. [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)

To run vim container:

    Add dvim to your path or copy to a file in your path (ie. /usr/local/bin)

Want to use your own plugs?
